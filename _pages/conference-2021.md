# The Bioinformatics Virtual Coordination Network presents:
# Holistic Bioinformatic Approaches used in Microbiome Research
A step-by-step open access conference showcasing state-of-the-art bioinformatics pipelines for microbiome research
 
The Bioinformatics Virtual Coordination Network (BVCN) is committed to reducing entry barriers into bioinformatics for researchers. For the first time in June 2021, this online conference will bring together early career researchers (ECRs) from across the globe who are equally committed to reducing such entry barriers, and who would like to exchange and share their research and bioinformatics experiences in a step-by-step format with a global and interdisciplinary audience.

**Background** The BVCN was established to facilitate entry of researchers in environmental and biomedical sciences into computational biology. To further this goal, this upcoming conference is designed to provide a platform for showcasing bioinformatic projects from inception to publication. The holistic analysis of data intensive projects may contain many steps that are not covered in the tutorials or documented in the methods section of publications - our speakers will try and capture these elements in their presentations.

## Conference details

### Presentations
Presentations will "premiere" twice daily through a live webinar format, where attendees will be encouraged to come watch together and collectively participate in crafting questions for the speakers. Can't make the premiere time? Don't worry! Presentations will simultaneously go live on YouTube and can be watched by anyone (not just conference attendees!)

### Speaker Panel Q&A
Instead of a Q&A session after each presentation, we will host one **LIVE** Q&A Session on the 4th day of the conference (10 June 2021). The Q&A will be only for conference attendees. A time will be selected to accommodate the maximum number of attendees, but we know conflicting time zones will impact some attendees. The Q&A will not be recorded, BUT a formalized question and response document will be created and shared with all attendees.

### Posters
Virtual posters must be submitted by **1 June 2021**

Posters will be available to all attendees starting on 5 June 2021 - 12 June 2021. Our conference chat platform will host a channel for each poster, where conversations can be started between the author(s) and other attendees. Two virtual poster sessions will be held with times optimized for both hemispheres. This virtual space will augment our chat platform and allow attendees to browse a virtual posters room with spontaneous video chats, similar to an in-person conference. See [Gather](https://gather.town/)

Posters and the poster session will not be available to the public.

Posters include:

* title
* abstract
* virtual poster optimized with accessibility elements (formats: 3-slide PowerPoint, PDF)
* (optional) voice recording of the poster (less than 3-minutes; format: MP4)
* (optional) one question that you want/need/desire to be answered. Think bioinformatic centric conversation starters, like: "How do I convert my data table to look like this type of figure?" or "Which tool performs this specific step I need in my analysis?" 

Poster awards: Graduate students and ECRs will be eligible for 1 of 3 poster prizes awarded to commemorate work that exemplifies open science approaches to bioinformatics.

### Accessibility
Primary conference language: English (our conference platforms allow for attendees to self-aggregate into channels for language options driven by the attendee community)

Recorded presentations will premiere with edited and cleaned closed captioning. Presentations will also be provided in PowerPoint format with alternative text provided for figures.

The Q&A Session will have Zoom provided live captioning and all questions and speaker answers will be recorded (and formalized) in a shared document format, providing a lasting resource for reference.

Attendees will be guided with instructions to make accessible versions of their posters. Poster formats that allow for screen reading software and alternative text will be required, along with (optional) attendee voice-overs introducing/describing their posters.

## Conference Diversity Goals

Country of residence and research topics will be considered in the final decision for attendees.

All decisions regarding attendees will be to maximize the diversity of the conference program.

## Selection Process

Expected attendee max. 150 with the following breakdown:

* Graduate Students (50%)
* Early Career Researchers (33%)
* Principal Investigators (17%)

Should attendee interest exceed our limit of 150 participants, we select attendees based on the following rubrics:

Graduate students and ECRs

* willingness to participate conference surveys
* response to the question: "How do you expect that attending the *Holistic Bioinformatic Approaches used in Microbiome Research* will enhance your research and/or studies? (Max. 240 characters)"
* country of current research institution
* interest in supplying a poster presentation
* participation or use of BVCN contents

Principal Investigators
 
* willingness to participate conference surveys
* response to the question: "Please provide a brief summary of your views regarding **good** mentorship of early career researchers, including your commitment to inclusive mentorship and practices in support of diversity and equity. (Max. 360 characters)"
* country of current research institution
* interest in supplying a poster presentation
